          My name is Mitchell Vieira, and I was born and raised just outside of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area), in a city of approximately 150,000 residents. 
          I attended Carleton University from 2017 to 2019, where I pursued a degree in Commerce before having to step away due to medical reasons. 
          Since then, I have gained experience in the retail sector and spent three years with Just Junk, a local waste management company. In this role, 
          I worked directly with customers, delivering prompt and courteous service.

        For over 3 years, I have immersed myself in web development through self-guided learning and structured online courses. 
        Iâ€™ve completed 100s of hours of coursework, over 1600 lessons, and a multitude of solo projects as part of Scrimba's "Frontend Career Path". 
        Alongside that, I have also followed along with a multitude of YouTube crash courses revolving around the MERN stack. 
        I am proficient in JavaScript, Typescript, React, NodeJS, Express, CSS (Tailwind Included), HTML, Git and am currently delving into the worlds of AWS, AI and Python.
